Tara was looking forward to the science fair this Monday.
Science was her favorite subject and someday Tara wanted to follow in her mother and grandmother’s footsteps to be a scientist for her future career.
Tara had planned out her experiment about plants and followed the scientific rubric that her teacher, Mrs. Winston, had outlined.
Last night Tara realized that her experiment would not work.
The plants that were in the dark basement and were not watered seemed to be growing better than the plants that were in the sun and being watered daily.
Tara knew that science experiments were to predict something was going to happen and to hypothesize why something would happen.
But how would Tara explain this?
She needed to switch gears and come up with a different idea.
Tara had stayed up through the night to do some research on plant experiments.
With a little luck and some scientific insight, this might just work out.
After a delicious breakfast of hot oatmeal sprinkled with brown sugar, Tara finished her freshly squeezed orange juice and was ready to go.
The experiments needed to be set up Monday morning so she needed to hurry.
Dusting off a large glass jar from the basement, Tara was headed in a new direction. “This will work out great!”
Tara shouted as she ran up the stairs.
Then she carefully placed a thin layer of sand followed by some black, rich dirt into the jar.
She grabbed some of the plants that had grown well from her first experiment and tucked a few into the dirt.
It took a little longer than she had thought because the top of the jar was quite narrow.
Tara carefully placed the hermit crabs into the sand.
They scrambled into their shells, a little frightened in their new environment.
Tara filled a small container of water and placed it against some rocks.
She made a mental note to refill the water daily so the crabs could have enough water if they needed some.
Then she sprinkled some of the crab food powder near the shells.
