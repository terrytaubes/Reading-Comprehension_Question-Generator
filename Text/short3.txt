The egg is a tiny, round or oval shape that gets attached by the female butterfly to a leaf, stem or other object.
The egg is usually attached near the intended caterpillar food.
The caterpillar or larva is the long, worm-like state of the butterfly.
It sometimes has an interesting pattern of stripes or patches.
It might have spine-like hairs.
This is the feeding and the growth stage of the butterfly.
As the caterpillar grows, it sheds its skin four or more times so it can enclose its rapidly growing body.
The chrysalis or pupa is the transformation stage.
The caterpillar tissues are broken down to form the adult insect structures.
Usually the chrysalis is brown or green color to blend into the surroundings.
Many times the chrysalis stage will remain this way over winter.
