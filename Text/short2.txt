Conflict resolution is a peaceful way of trying to solve a conflict with resolution.
Both sides in the conflict explain what they feel happened to cause the conflict.
The person who listens to both sides is called the mediator.
After both sides state what they feel happened to cause the conflict, they discuss ways to solve the conflict.
They try to come up with a “resolution” that both sides agree to.
Communication throughout the entire conflict resolution process is always exchanged in a calm manner without anger.
Everyone attempts to use good listening and attending skills while people are talking.
If voices get too loud or it appears that someone is angry, the mediator’s role is to address this and have the people treat each other with respect.
