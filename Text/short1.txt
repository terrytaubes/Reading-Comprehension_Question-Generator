Soil is found on the upper most layer of the Earth.
It is made up of a mixture of rock, minerals, plants, and some living/dead animals (mostly insects).
This nutrient-rich layer of soil extends downward a few feet.
This is about how far the roots of plants grow.
Soil is made up of all the nutrients needed by plants to live.
Some areas of the world like desert regions have very poor soil.
Here, it is difficult for complex plant life to take hold.
Tropical rainforests also have poor soil.
Yes, the rainforest region gets enough rainfall to grow plants, but the poor soil found in rainforests is caused by so many living plants.
These plants have the nutrients right inside themselves, so nutrients are not abundantly found in the soil.
